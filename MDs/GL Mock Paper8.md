## The Wonderful Wizard of Oz

by L. Frank Baum

*Dorothy lives in the American state of Kansas with her family and her dog, Toto. One day, a cyclone hits her farm, lifting her house from the ground with Dorothy inside. This extract picks up where Dorothy has awoken to find herself transported to the magical land of Oz.*

1. She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.

The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.

10. The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvellous beauty. There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, grey prairies.
15. While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.
20. Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.
30. When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:

"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage."

35. Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.

But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, "You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything."

"Your house did, anyway," replied the little old woman, with a laugh, "and that is the same thing. See!" she continued, pointing to the corner of the house. "There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood."

Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.

### Section 2

To answer these questions you have to work out a code. In the boxes on the left are shapes and the code letters that go with them. The top letters mean something different to the bottom ones. You must decide how the letters go with the shapes. Then find the correct code for the **test shape** from the set of five codes on the right and **mark its letter on your answer sheet**. The examples below have been done for you and the answers marked on the answer sheet.

#### Example 1

Image: Example 1: A code puzzle with three examples and a test shape.

The diagram shows three examples of shapes and their codes, followed by a test shape and five options (A-E).

**Examples:**

- A white circle with an 'X' at the top and an 'S' at the bottom.
- A shaded square with a 'Y' at the top and a 'T' at the bottom.
- A white square with a 'Y' at the top and an 'S' at the bottom.

**TEST SHAPE:** A shaded circle.

**Options:**

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Y | X | Y | X | X |
| T | T | S | S | Y |

**A B C D E**

**Answer: B**

In the example above, both squares have a Y at the top but the circle has an X, so the top code must be for shape. Both white shapes have an S at the bottom, but the shaded shape has a T, so the bottom code must be for shading. The test shape is a shaded circle so its code letters must be X for circle and T for shading, and **B** has been marked on the answer sheet. Now look at the second example:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                  |

In these questions, find the two words, one from each group, that will complete the sentence in the best way.

Mark both words on the answer sheet.

**Example**      **Big** is to (small    orange    colour) as **wide** is to (apple    red    narrow).

|          |          |
|----------|----------|
| A small  | X apple  |
| B orange | Y red    |
| C colour | Z narrow |

**Answer**      **small    narrow**

**Solution**      In this example, 'big' is to **small** as 'wide' is to '**narrow**' is correct because the word relationships here are antonyms (opposites). For other questions, the word relationship will be something different (pay attention to word type as well as

meaning) but the important thing to remember is that the first relationship will connect with the second relationship.

In these questions, one letter can be moved from the first word to the second word to make two new words.

The letters must not otherwise be rearranged and both new words must make sense.  
Find the letter that moves and mark it on the answer sheet.

**Example** pound or

A P

B o

C u

D N

E D

**Answer** U

**Solution** The answer is **u**: when removed from the word 'pound', we get a new word '**pond**' and when added to the word 'or' we get a new word '**our**'. The letters have not otherwise been rearranged and both new words make sense.

These questions contain three pairs of words.

Find the word that completes the last pair of words in the **same way** as the other two pairs.

Mark it on the answer sheet.

**Example** (band ban)

(song son)

(tear [ ? ])

A ear

B tea

C tar

D are

E eat

**Answer** tea

**Solution** In the first two pairs of words, the second word has been made from the first three letters of 'band' to make the word 'ban'. Likewise in the second pair of words, 'song' makes the word 'son'. If you apply the same rule to the third pair of words, you get the answer 'tea'.
