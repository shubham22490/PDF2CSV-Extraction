## The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde

by Robert Louis Stevenson

*Dr Jekyll is a well-respected scientist living in 19<sup>th</sup> century London. In an effort to bring out the darker side of himself with no consequences to his own reputation, he creates a potion that transforms him into Mr Hyde, an evil, remorseless villain. This extract recounts a maid's account of seeing Mr Hyde beat a man named Sir Danvers Carew to death, and how word gets to the dead man's lawyer, Mr Utterson, who has been attempting to unmask the mysterious Mr Hyde for some time.*

1. Nearly a year later, in the month of October 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat, she
10. became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come within speech (which was just under the maid's eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it
15. sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered her a word and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden, he
20. broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered, and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.
30. It was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered

half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.

35.

This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip. "I shall say nothing till I have seen the body," said he; "this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait while I dress." And with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.

40.

"Yes," said he, "I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew."

"Good God, sir," exclaimed the officer, "is it possible?" And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. "This will make a deal of noise," he said.

In these questions, find the two words, one from each group, that will complete the sentence in the best way.

Mark both words on the answer sheet.

**Example**    **Big** is to (small    orange    colour) as **wide** is to (apple    red    narrow).

**Answer**    **small    narrow**

**Solution**    In this example, 'big' is to **small** as 'wide' is to **narrow** is correct because the word relationships here are antonyms (opposites). For other questions, the word relationship will be something different (pay attention to word type as well as meaning) but the important thing to remember is that the first relationship will connect with the second relationship.

These questions contain three pairs of words.

Find the word that completes the last pair of words in the **same way** as the other two pairs. Mark it on the answer sheet.

**Example** (band ban) (song son) (tear [ ? ])  
A ear B tea C tar D are E eat

**Answer** tea

**Solution** In the first two pairs of words, the second word has been made from the first three letters of 'band' to make the word 'ban'. Likewise in the second pair of words, 'song' makes the word 'son'. If you apply the same rule to the third pair of words, you get the answer 'tea'.

### SECTION 2

On the left of the example below there are two shapes with an arrow between them. Decide how the second is related to the first. After these there is a third shape, then an arrow and five more shapes. Decide which of the five shapes goes with the **third** one to **make a pair** with the two on the left. Its letter has been marked on your answer sheet.

Example

![Example question: A white triangle points to a black triangle. A colon follows, then a white square points to a white hexagon. Below these are five options: A (white hexagon), B (white square), C (white triangle), D (black square), and E (black pentagon).](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgpvwrolc/image/upload/v1770637942/lwrvogxajfv0yu6lef9v.jpg)

A white triangle points to a black triangle. A colon follows, then a white square points to a white hexagon. Below these are five options: A (white hexagon), B (white square), C (white triangle), D (black square), and E (black pentagon).

Example question: A white triangle points to a black triangle. A colon follows, then a white square points to a white hexagon. Below these are five options: A (white hexagon), B (white square), C (white triangle), D (black square), and E (black pentagon).

Explanation : The triangle is shaded black so the square will also be shaded black. Hence D is the correct answer.

Now do the practice questions below.  
Mark the correct answers on your answer sheet.

### SECTION 3

To answer these questions you have to work out a code. On the left are some shapes and the code letters that go with them. You must decide how the code letters go with the shapes. Then find the correct code for the **test shape** from the set of five codes on the right. **Mark its letter on your answer sheet**. The example have been done for you.

### SECTION 4

To answer these questions you have to work out a code. In the boxes on the left are shapes and the code letters that go with them. The top letters mean something different to the bottom ones. You must decide how the letters go with the shapes. Then find the correct code for the **test shape** from the set of five codes on the right and **mark its letter on your answer sheet**. The examples below have been done for you and the answers marked on the answer sheet.
